# ReviewSensor

Inspired by analytics and travel, ReviewSensor takes the pain out of scouring through hotel reviews to find the best match. Using machine learning and natural language understanding, the user will be able to see the percentage of positive, neutral, and negative content, emotions felt, and keywords extracted from the reviews of their preferred hotel findings.

Technologies used: JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, Angular 2) MongoDB, Yelp API, IBM Watson API, Twilio API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
